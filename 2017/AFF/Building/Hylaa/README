This is the repeatability package for the Hylaa tool for the ARCH workshop tool competition 2017, prepared by Stanley Bak in April 2017.

Please download and install version 1.0 of Hylaa from this link: https://github.com/stanleybak/hylaa/releases/tag/v1.0 . Installation instructions are in the README which comes with the tool.

Hylaa only had results in the competition for the building benchmark. To recreate these results, run each of the python scripts from a terminal (using the python command). Here is a description of each script:


* building_timing.py - Timing measurement for safe case. This corresponds to model BLDF01, specification BLDS01. Note your timing may vary from the report based on your machine.

* building_affine_timing.py - Timing measurements for the safe case (affine dynamics, not time-varying inputs). This corresponds to model BLDC01, specification BLDS01. Note your timing may vary from the report based on your machine.

* building_unsafe.py - Timing measurement for the unsafe case #1. This corresponds to model BLDF01, specification BLDU01. Note your timing may vary from the report based on your machine.

* building_unsafe2.py - Timing measurement for the unsafe case #2. This corresponds to model BLDF01, specification BLDU02. Note your timing may vary from the report based on your machine.

* building_plot_1sec.py - Produces 1 second plot (hylaa_building_1sec.png). This takes longer than the timing measurement due to the overhead of plotting.

* building_plot_20sec.py - Produces 20 second plot (hylaa_building_20sec.png). This takes a few minutes to run, due to the overhead of plotting.
