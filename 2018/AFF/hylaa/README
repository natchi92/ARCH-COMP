This is the repeatability package for the Hylaa tool, master branch, for the ARCH workshop tool competition 2018, prepared by Stanley Bak in May 2018.

Please download and install version 1.1 of Hylaa from this link: https://github.com/stanleybak/hylaa/releases/tag/v1.1 . Installation instructions are in the README which comes with the tool.

To recreate Hylaa's results, make sure it's on your PYTHONPATH (follow the Hylaa installation instructions), and then run the python scripts included here.  The scripts are named based on the model / safety property they check. Some scripts may compute multiple model / properties and then print a summary.
