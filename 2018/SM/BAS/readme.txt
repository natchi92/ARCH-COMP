Repeatability package for FAUST2 for BAS benchmark
Nathalie Cauchi, July 2018.

Dependencies: Matlab together with the following toolboxes: YALMIP, CVX, tbxmanager install mpt cdd lcp


All the code is found within benchBAS.zip
Please unzip this file and then run the main.m file within Matlab in the same folder containing FAUST2 folder. This file will run both benchmarks one after the other. It will automatically cause the script to pause after the computation of the first benchmark has finished. The user can then press any key to run the second benchmark. 

The results for each case are saved as .mat files. For the first benchmark the file is called Cs1.mat, while for the second it is called Cs2.mat.
